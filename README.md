This project is a secure JWKS server using Flask and SQLite for JWT-based authentication. It encrypts private keys with AES, hashes passwords with Argon2, and provides endpoints for user registration, authentication, and JWKS retrieval. Features include secure JWT generation, logging authentication requests, and rate limiting. The server prevents SQL injection and enhances security through robust practices.
